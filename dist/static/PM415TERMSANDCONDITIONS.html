Customer shall at all times during the Term: (a) set up, maintain and operate in good repair and in accordance with the Specifications all Customer Systems on or through which the Services are accessed or used; (b) provide PM415 Personnel with such access to Customer&rsquo;s premises and Customer Systems as is necessary for PM415 to perform the Services in accordance with the Availability Requirement and Specifications; and (c) provide all cooperation and assistance as PM415 may reasonably request to enable PM415 to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under and in connection with this Agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">4.2.

Service Level Agreement and Support.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">5.1. Service Level Agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">(a) Service Levels. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, PM415 will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Hosted Services Available at least 99.95% (the &ldquo;Service Commitment&rdquo;) of the time as measured over the course of each case during each billing month during the Term, a &ldquo;Service Period&rdquo;), excluding unAvailability as a result of any of the Exceptions described below in this Section (the &ldquo;Availability Requirement&rdquo;). &ldquo;Service Level Failure&rdquo; means when all of Customer&rsquo;s running instances of the Hosted Services are not Available (i.e., are unAvailable). &ldquo;Available&rdquo; means the given Hosted Services have external connectivity to the Internet. For purposes of calculating the Availability Requirement, the following are &ldquo;Exceptions&rdquo; to the Availability Requirement, and neither the Hosted Services will be considered unAvailable nor any Service Level Failure be deemed to have occurred in connection with any failure to meet the Availability Requirement or impaired ability of Customer or its Authorized Users to access or use the Hosted Services that is due, in whole or in part, to any: (a) act or omission by Customer, any Authorized User, any third Person outside of PM415&rsquo;s direct control (with PM415&rsquo;s Subcontractors, including, but not limited to its hosting provider being within PM415&rsquo;s control), including, without limitation, any third Person who accesses or uses the Hosted Services by or through Customer, any Authorized User, or of the Customer&rsquo;s Access Credentials, that does not strictly comply with this Agreement and the Specifications; (b) Force Majeure Event or any other circumstances beyond PM415&rsquo;s reasonable control, including Customer&rsquo;s or any Authorized User&rsquo;s use or misuse of any Third Party Materials; (c) Customer Failure; (d) Customer&rsquo;s or its Authorized User&rsquo;s Internet connectivity; (e) failure, interruption, outage or other problem with any software, hardware, system, network, facility or other matter not supplied by PM415, or its Subcontractors under the direction of PM415, pursuant to this Agreement; (f) Scheduled Downtime; (g) disabling, suspension or termination of the Services pursuant to Section 5 of these Terms and Conditions; or (h) any other suspension or termination of Customer&rsquo;s or any Authorized Users&rsquo; access to or use of the Hosted Services as permitted by this Agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">(b) Service Level Failures and Remedies. In the event of a Service Level Failure and so long as Customer is not then in default under any provision of this Agreement, PM415 shall issue a credit to Customer equal to that percentage of time when the given Hosted Services were unAvailable over and above the Service Commitment multiplied by the total monthly Fees (if the fees are paid annually, such annual fee will be divided 12 to determine the monthly Fees for this purpose) for the affected Hosted Services due for the Service Period in which the Service Level Failure occurred (each a &ldquo;Service Credit&rdquo;) (For example, if the Services were Available 99% of the time, the Services were then unAvailable for 0.95% beyond the Service Commitment, and so, Customer would receive a Service Credit equal to 0.95% of the monthly Fees for the affected Hosted Services) subject to the following:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">i. PM415 has no obligation to issue any Service Credit unless (i) Customer reports the Service Failure to PM415 immediately on becoming aware of it; and (ii) requests the applicable Service Credit in writing within 10 days of the Service Level Failure; and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">ii. In no event will a Service Level Credit for any Service Period exceed total monthly Fees that would be payable for that Service Period if no Service Level Failure had occurred.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">(c) Sole Liability. Any Service Credit payable to Customer under this Agreement will be issued to Customer in the calendar month following the Service Period in which the Service Level Failure occurred. PM415 will only apply Service Credits against future Fee payments otherwise due under this Agreement. Service Credits shall not entitle Customer to any refund or other payment from PM415. A Service Credit will be applicable and issued only if the credit amount for the applicable monthly billing cycle is greater than one dollar. Service Credits may not be transferred or applied to any other account or party. This Section 1 sets forth PM415&rsquo;s sole obligation and liability and Customer&rsquo;s sole remedy for any Service Level Failure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">(d) Scheduled Downtime. PM415 will use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule downtime for routine maintenance of the Hosted Services between the hours of 11:00 p.m. on Friday and 1:00 a.m. Saturday Eastern Time (any such scheduled downtime being &ldquo;Scheduled Downtime&rdquo;).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">(e) Amendment. This Service Level Agreement and this Section 5.1 may be amended by PM415 at any time and from time to time upon delivery of notice to Customer, which notice may be made through email, other electronic communication or on PM415&rsquo;s support website.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">5.2 Support.
